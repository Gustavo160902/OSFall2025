Arkhipenko, A. (2024). TaskScheduler for Arduino [Software]. GitHub. https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler   
 This repository provides a cooperative scheduling library that allows multiple timed tasks on Arduino boards.    
Difference: Our project uses this as the foundation but focuses on measuring its fairness, latency, and performance instead of extending the code show.    

Arduino Forum. (2024, January 15). TaskScheduler library – User experiences [Online forum post].   
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/taskscheduler-library-what-are-your-experiences/675944   
 This forum thread collects user experiences, debugging advice, real problems and solutions, and performance reports from the TaskScheduler library.      
Difference: We perform controlled experiments and quantitative measurements instead of anecdotal observations.     
   
Bacon, R. S. (2021, May 29). #253 Accurate task scheduler for the Arduino (and STM32, ESP32...) [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJUlH_rWOE&t=670s 
 This video demonstrates building an accurate task scheduler for microcontrollers and visualizing its timing behavior.     
Difference: Our project uses the official TaskScheduler library rather than writing one from scratch and emphasizes fairness testing.   
  
Circuitstate. (2023, January 4). ptScheduler – A minimal cooperative task scheduler for Arduino. Circuitstate Electronics. https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/ptscheduler-a-minimal-cooperative-task-scheduler-for-arduino/ 
 This article presents a lightweight scheduler that runs multiple tasks using cooperative timing.     
Difference: We analyze an existing advanced library rather than designing a minimal new scheduler.   
   
FreeRTOS. (2024). FreeRTOS documentation. Real Time Engineers Ltd. https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/00-Overview 
The FreeRTOS documentation explains preemptive scheduling, task priorities, and kernel timing used in embedded systems.     
Difference: Our study compares cooperative scheduling behavior against these preemptive methods for educational analysis.

This research analyzes low-resource schedulers used in IoT microcontrollers.    
Difference: We reproduce a similar concept but limit our evaluation to Arduino TaskScheduler in cooperative mode.    
   
Liu, C. L., & Layland, J. W. (1973). Scheduling algorithms for multiprogramming in a hard-real-time environment. Journal of the ACM, 20(1), 46–61. https://doi.org/10.1145/321738.321743 
This classic paper defines foundational real-time scheduling theory such as rate-monotonic and earliest-deadline-first algorithms.    
Difference: Our work uses these ideas conceptually but tests a practical cooperative implementation on Arduino hardware.    
   
Majumdar, S. (2022, August 10). Cooperative vs preemptive multitasking in embedded systems. Embedded.com.  
https://www.embedded.com/the-basics-of-embedded-multitasking-on-a-pic-part-1-reentrant-multitasking/?utm_source 
Explains the trade-offs between cooperative and preemptive multitasking in embedded environments.     
Difference: We provide experimental data comparing these approaches rather than theoretical discussion.    
   
Moya, P. (2020, July 27). Arduino multitasking without RTOS. Hackster.io.   
https://www.hackster.io/onelife/multitasking-on-arduino-b5f216 
Shows how to simulate multitasking on Arduino without an operating system.     
Difference: We rely on an actual scheduler library to test systematic fairness and timing instead of simple non-blocking loops.    
    
Wokwi Simulator. (2024). TaskScheduler example [Software simulation]. Wokwi. https://wokwi.com/projects/307248583887815233 
Demonstrates the TaskScheduler library running inside an online simulator.    
Difference: We run equivalent experiments on real Arduino hardware to collect physical timing data.
