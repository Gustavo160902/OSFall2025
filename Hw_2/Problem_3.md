### Design: Implements a Ticket Lock and a CAS Spinlock. The Ticket Lock uses atomic.AddUint32 as a FAA substitute. The SpinLock uses atomic.CompareAndSwapUint32. The benchmark measure the average wait time under different contention, different amount of threads/goroutines, over 1000 iterations.

# Analysis
The Ticket Lock average times seems to be increasing linearly and take more time than the spin lock.
