## Problem 2 – Virtual and Physical Address Bits with Paging

### Question 1
32-bit operating system, 4-KB pages, 1 GB of RAM

a) 32 bits (virtual address bits given by OS)  
b) 30 bits (physical address bits = log2(1 × 2^30))  
c) 20 bits (virtual page number bits = 32 − 12)  
d) 18 bits (physical frame number bits = 30 − 12)  
e) 12 bits (page offset bits = log2(4 × 1024))

### Question 2
32-bit operating system, 16-KB pages, 2 GB of RAM

a) 32 bits (virtual address bits given by OS)  
b) 31 bits (physical address bits = log2(2 × 2^30))  
c) 18 bits (virtual page number bits = 32 − 14)  
d) 17 bits (physical frame number bits = 31 − 14)  
e) 14 bits (page offset bits = log2(16 × 1024))

### Question 3
64-bit operating system, 16-KB pages, 16 GB of RAM

a) 64 bits (virtual address bits given by OS)  
b) 34 bits (physical address bits = log2(16 × 2^30))  
c) 50 bits (virtual page number bits = 64 − 14)  
d) 20 bits (physical frame number bits = 34 − 14)  
e) 14 bits (page offset bits = log2(16 × 1024))
