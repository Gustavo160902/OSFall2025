## Problem 2 – Comparing Queue Algorithms

For this problem, I created two versions of a concurrent queue in Go.

The first one is a **Two-Lock Queue** that uses two normal sync.Mutex locks: one for adding items and one for removing items.  
The second one is a **Lock-Free Queue** that uses atomic operations from Go’s sync/atomic package so it can work without locks.

Both queues run four goroutines that enqueue and dequeue numbers at the same time.  
The test prints how long each queue takes to complete.

### Analysis
The Two-Lock Queue was faster in my test.  
This happens because using normal locks is simpler and faster when there are only a few goroutines.  
The Lock-Free Queue needs more CPU work because it uses atomic Compare-And-Swap operations and retries when updates fail.  
When there are many threads running, the Lock-Free version usually performs better since it lets all threads make progress without waiting for locks.

### Consistency with reference
My result matches what Michael and Scott explained in his documentation.  
The two-lock queue is good under light load, and the lock-free version scales better under heavy contention because it avoids blocking.

### How to Run

Save the file as `main.go` in your Go workspace.  
Open a terminal in that folder and run
